**Event emitter element**

Event emitters trigger an event to which anyone can listen. Different libraries offer different implementations and for different purposes, but the basic idea is to provide a framework for issuing events and subscribing to them.

`polymer-signals` offers an implementation for event emitting but currently lacks the following features:

* Wildcards
* Namespaces
* Time to listen
* Deliminators
* Now/many
* Max listeners

I'll be trying to add some of these features.
